### A rewrite of [Marked 2](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/52aeeadab2a37d1efb000002) in C

A user on the Rebble discord posted recently that they loved the [Marked 2](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/52aeeadab2a37d1efb000002) watchface, but since the original developer's website was down they were unable to change certain settings. I decided to take this opportunity to learn how to create watchfaces for Pebble, and used a combination of my miniscule C knowledge, the Pebble developer documentation, and GitHub Copilot to write this.
